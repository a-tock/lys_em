Introduction
==========================

*lys_em* is a Python library that enables electron diffraction simulations using the multislice method and the analysis of experimental data.
In the analysis, the use of Sympy objects allows for easy parameter optimization.

The library mainly relies on the following packages for computation:

- numpy
- Sympy
- JAX

For simulations and analyses based on crystal structures, the following library is used:

- `lys_mat <https://a-tock.github.io/lys_mat/index.html>`_
